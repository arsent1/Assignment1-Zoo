          Koalas are iconic marsupials native to Australia, known for their endearing appearance and unique lifestyle. 
          These tree-dwelling mammals are often mistaken for bears due to their bear-like features, but they are actually 
          marsupials. Koalas primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which not only form the bulk of their diet but also give 
          them their distinctive scent. With their fluffy ears and round faces, koalas have captured the hearts of people 
          worldwide. Unfortunately, they face numerous threats, including habitat loss and climate change, making 
          conservation efforts crucial to ensuring their survival in the wild.
