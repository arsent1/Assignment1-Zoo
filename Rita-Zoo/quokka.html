          Quokkas are small marsupials native to Australia, known for their endearing and perpetually smiling expressions, 
          earning them the nickname "the happiest animal on Earth." These herbivorous creatures are about the size of a 
          domestic cat and are primarily found in the southwestern region of Australia, particularly on Rottnest Island. 
          Quokkas are known for their friendly and curious nature, making them a popular subject for wildlife enthusiasts 
          and photographers. Despite their adorable appearance, they are wild animals and should be observed from a respectful 
          distance to ensure their well-being and preservation in their natural habitat.
