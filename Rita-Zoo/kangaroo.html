          Kangaroos are iconic marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive hopping 
          locomotion and powerful hind legs. These unique creatures have adapted to the continent's diverse 
          landscapes, from arid deserts to lush forests. Kangaroos are herbivores, primarily grazing on vegetation, 
          and they have a pouch in which they carry and nurture their underdeveloped offspring, called joeys. 
          With their strong tails for balance and large, expressive ears, kangaroos are a symbol of Australia's rich 
          wildlife and are beloved by people worldwide.
