        <p>Sloths reside in the tropical rainforests of South America and Central America. There are 6 
            species of sloths in 2 genera (Bradypus - three-toed sloths, and Choloepus - two-toed sloths).
            Sloths are primarily known for their slow speeds and low metabolism. In some languages, 
            "sloth" literally means <em>lazy</em> or something similar. They are helpless on the ground,
            but do possess the ability to swim. Many species that no longer exist are thought to be due 
            to the arrival of humans and climate change.
