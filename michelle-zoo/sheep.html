        <p>Sheep are mostly domesticated animals. There are around one billion sheep in the world, and they are mammals
            typically kept as livestock, maintained for their wool, milk, and meat. An adult female is also known as an <em>ewe</em>, 
            an adult male male is also known as a <em>ram</em>, and a young sheep is also known as a <em>lamb</em>. They most likely
            originated from another type of sheep called mouflon native to Cyprus. They have a deep history, appearing in both old 
            and modern rituals as sacrificial animals. Their wool is also very valuable in trading markets. There are now estimated to 
            be over 200 breeds of sheep.
