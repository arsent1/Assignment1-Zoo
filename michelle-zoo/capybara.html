        <p>Capybaras are a semiaquatic rodent species native to South America. It is the largest living rodent,
            and are considered close relatives to guinea pigs, other small creatures. Like humans,
            they are very social and can often be found in groups of 100, and live with a few tens 
            of other capybaras. They usually live in savannas and near bodies of water in tropical rainforests. 
            Although they are hunted for their meat, they are not an endangered species. Capybaras have 
            short heads and long, round bodies, with red/yellow-brown hair. They are picky herbivores, eating 
            mainly grass, aquatic plants, fruit, and tree bark. They typically live 8-10 years.
