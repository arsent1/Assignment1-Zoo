        <p>The hippopotamus, or hippo, is a semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is the third largest land animal
            after elephants and rhinoceros. They are hairless and very large, as adult males, on average, weigh about 3,300 pounds,
            and adult females, on average, weigh about 2,900 pounds. Although very large, they are capable of running 19 mph for 
            short distances. The hippos we are familiar with, along with another species known as pygmy hippopotamus, are the 
            only living members of the <em>Hippopotamidae</em>.
