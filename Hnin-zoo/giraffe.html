            The giraffe, a remarkable African hoofed mammal belonging to the Giraffa genus, holds the distinction of being Earth's tallest terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Traditionally believed to comprise a single species with nine subspecies.
            Key features of giraffes include their incredibly long necks and legs, horn-like ossicones, and distinctive spotted coat patterns. These gentle giants range across Africa, from Chad to South Africa, typically inhabiting savannahs and woodlands.
            Their diet mainly consists of leaves, fruits, and flowers from woody plants, notably acacia species, which they can reach due to their exceptional height. They live in herds of related females and offspring or bachelor groups of unrelated males,
            sometimes forming large gatherings. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking," combat involving their necks as weapons, gaining mating access to females. Female giraffes bear the sole responsibility for raising their young.
