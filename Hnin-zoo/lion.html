      The lion, scientifically known as Panthera leo, is a prominent and iconic large cat native to Africa and India. It is characterized by its muscular body, distinctive mane in adult males, and a social nature, often forming groups called prides.
       These prides consist of adult males, related females, and cubs, with females often hunting together, primarily preying on large ungulates. 
      While lions are predators, they occasionally scavenge and, rarely, hunt humans. They primarily inhabit grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands, 
      displaying a more diurnal behavior but adapting to nocturnal activity when persecuted. However, lion populations have significantly declined, with habitat loss and human conflicts as major concerns, leading to their listing as Vulnerable. 
      Despite these challenges, lions hold a special place in human culture, symbolizing strength and majesty, and have been depicted in various art forms and cultures throughout history, making them a globally recognized and revered species.
